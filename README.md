# SQL Server Dsc Configuration
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/UPDATEME?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/kewalaka/sqlserverdscconfig)

This is my first attempt to create a composite resource using testing & re-use techniques proposed by 
[Gael Colas](https://github.com/gaelcolas), from his [SharedDscConfig](https://github.com/gaelcolas/SharedDScConfig) repository.

The [SharedDscConfig](https://github.com/gaelcolas/SharedDScConfig) repository is the best information about the structure followed by this project

## How to use

Coming later!
